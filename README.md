# Description:
Add vi/vim-like modes and keybindings to WeeChat.


# Download:
weechat-vimode is available in the WeeChat scripts repo. You can install it by
running the following command:

    /script install vimode.py

The version on GitHub may be more recent. You can install it from the shell as
follows:

    cd ~/.weechat/python/
    wget 'https://github.com/GermainZ/weechat-vimode/raw/master/vimode.py'
    cd autoload/
    ln -s ../vimode.py .

If you prefer to clone the git repo (allowing you to easily update it), you can
do the following instead:

    git clone 'https://github.com/GermainZ/weechat-vimode.git'
    ln -s /path/to/git/repo/vimode.py ~/.weechat/python/autoload/vimode.py

If you're using Arch Linux, you can also install
[weechat-vimode-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/weechat-vimode-git/)
from the AUR.

# Usage:
To switch to Normal mode, press `Esc` or `Ctrl+Space`. You can also use an
alternate mapping while in Insert mode, similar to `:image jk <Esc>` in vim.
See the `imap_esc` and `imap_esc_timeout` options for more details.

Three bar items are provided:

* **mode_indicator**: shows the currently active mode (e.g. `NORMAL`). Has
  various customization options (see `/fset vimode.mode_indicator`).
* **vi_buffer**: shows partial commands (e.g. `df`).
* **cmd_completion**: shows completion suggestions for `:commands` (triggered
  with `<Tab>`).

It is highly recommended you add **mode_indicator** and **vi_buffer** to your
input bar. For example:

* `/fset weechat.bar.input.items`
* `<Alt+Enter>`
* Add `mode_indicator+` at the start, and `,[vi_buffer]` at the end.
* Final result example:
    `"mode_indicator+[input_prompt]+(away),[input_search],
    [input_paste],input_text,[vi_buffer]"`

You can also add **cmd_completion** to the status bar:

* `/fset weechat.bar.status.items`
* `<Alt+Enter>`
* Add `,cmd_completion` at the end.
* Final result example:
    `""[time],[buffer_last_number],[buffer_plugin],buffer_number+:+buffer_name+(buffer_modes)+{buffer_nicklist_count}+buffer_zoom+buffer_filter,scroll,[lag],[hotlist],completion,cmd_completion"`

To switch back to Insert mode, you can use `i`, `a`, `A`, etc.

To execute an Ex command, simply precede it with a ":" while in Normal mode,
for example: ":h" or ":s/foo/bar".


# Showing line numbers:
The `vi_line_numbers` bar (comes with a bar item) is provided but hidden by
default, and can be shown to display line numbers next to the chat window
(similar to vi's `:set number`). You can show it by using the command:
`/set weechat.bar.vi_line_numbers.hidden off`.

(Depending on your configuration, you may need to adjust some of its settings
for it to be displayed correctly, but the defaults should suit most users.)

It is useful for `:<num>` commands, which will start WeeChat's cursor mode and
take you to the appropriate line. You can then use the default key bindings to
quote the message (`Q`, `m` and `q`).

You can customize the prefix/suffix for each line: `/fset vimode.line_number`.


# Enabling vim-like search:
By default, pressing `/` will simply launch WeeChat's search mode.

Optionally, weechat-vimode can also handle `n`/`N` presses after pressing `/`
and confirming the query. To enable this setting:
`/set plugins.var.python.vimode.search_vim on`.
Note that having this setting enabled will require an extra `<Enter>` press to
exit search mode (where only `n`/`N` are recognized and handled) and return to
Normal mode. When in search mode, pressing `/` will start a new search.

* `:bd`, `:bdel`, `:bdelete`
                    Close the current buffer (`/close`).
* `:b#`             Go to the last buffer (`/input jump_last_buffer`).
* `:b [N]`, `:bu [N]`, `:buf [N]`, `:buffer [N]`

* `:sp`, `:split`   Split current window in two (`/window splith`).

* `:s/pattern/repl`  
  `:s/pattern/repl/g`
                    Search/Replace \*
* `:<num>`          Start cursor mode and go to line.
* `:nmap`           List user-defined key mappings.
* `:nmap {lhs} {rhs}`
                    Map `{lhs}` to `{rhs}` for Normal mode.  Some (but not all) vim-like key codes are
                    supported: `<Up>`, `<Down>`, `<Left>`, `<Right>`, `<C-...>` and `<M-...>`. These "user
                    mappings" share much of the flexibility you are accustomed to from using regular
                    vim mappings. See the [User Mappings](#usermaps) section for details and examples.
* `:nunmap {lhs}`   Remove the mapping of `{lhs}` for Normal mode.
* `:command`        All other commands will be passed to WeeChat (e.g.
                    ":script …" is equivalent to "/script …").

\* Supports regex (check docs for the Python re module for more
information). `&` in the replacement is also substituted by the pattern. If the
`g` flag isn't present, only the first match will be substituted.

# <a name="usermaps"></a>User Mappings
User mappings are created using `:nmap {lhs} {rhs}`. The `{rhs}` argument consists of any
combination of the following:

* A WeeChat command, specified with: `/command [options]<CR>`. You may also use a colon (`:`)
  in place of the forward slash (`/`) if you wish.
* An INSERT mode action, specified by an `A`, `I`, `i`, or `a` to enter INSERT mode; then an
  (optional) arbitrary string of characters to send to the command-line; and then (optionally) ending the
  pattern with a `<CR>` (to submit the text to the current buffer) or a `<Esc>` to end the INSERT
  mode action and go back to NORMAL mode.
* Keys specifying a vim motion (`h`,`j`,`k`,`l`,`^`,`0`, etc.).
* Keys specifying a vim operation (`dd`, `y$`, `cw`, etc.).

A count may be specified either in the mapping itself or before triggering the mapping.
Furthermore, you may place the following count tag anywhere (except inside an INSERT action) within
the binding (`{rhs}`): `#{N}`, where `N` is some arbitrary integer. This special "count tag" is used to
consume an external count. If no external count is provided, `N` will be used as the default
count. This will all probably be easier to grasp after seeing a few examples:

### Examples

1) Commands can be concatenated together:
     - INPUT: `:nmap h /cmd1<CR>/cmd2<CR>`
     - OUTPUT [h]: Runs `/cmd1` then `/cmd2`.

2) User defined bindings will be followed:
     - INPUT: `:nmap j /buffer 5<CR>h`
     - OUTPUT [j]: Go to the fifth buffer, then run `/cmd1`, and then run `/cmd2`.

3) Bindings can take advantage of INSERT mode:
     - INPUT: `:nmap k i/msg <Esc>0i`
     - OUTPUT [k]: Prints "/msg " to the command-line and then returns the user to the beginning of the line. The user is left in INSERT mode.

4) Counts are respected both internally and externally:
     - INPUT: `:nmap j 3J`
     - OUTPUT [j]: Go three buffers down.
     - OUTPUT [3j]: Go nine buffers down.

5) Special "count tag" gives you more flexibility when using external counts:
     - INPUT: `:nmap @ /buffer #{3}<CR>`
     - OUTPUT [7@]: Go to the seventh buffer.
     - OUTPUT [@]: Go to the third buffer.

# History:
* version 0.1:      initial release
* version 0.2:      added esc to switch to Normal mode, various key bindings
                    and commands.
* version 0.2.1:    fixes/refactoring
* version 0.3:      separate operators from motions and better handling. Added
                    yank operator, I/p. Other fixes and improvements. The
                    Escape key should work flawlessly on WeeChat ≥ 0.4.4.
* version 0.4:      added: f, F, t, T, r, R, W, E, B, gt, gT, J, K, ge, gE, X,
                    ~, ,, ;, ^^, ^Wh, ^Wj, ^Wk, ^Wl, ^W=, ^Wx, ^Ws, ^Wv, ^Wq,
                    :!cmd, :sp, :vsp.
                    Improved substitutions (:s/foo/bar). Rewrote key handling
                    logic to take advantage of WeeChat API additions.
                    Many fixes and improvements. WeeChat ≥ 1.0.0 required.
* version 0.5:      added: line numbers bar (disabled by default), :<num>
                    commands, C, D. Many fixes and improvements.
* version 0.6:      added python3 support, `:imap <key_sequence> <Esc>`,
                    `/vimode_go_to_normal` for use in user-defined key
                    bindings, nt/nT to scroll nicklist, support for
                    user-defined commands for copying/pasting, simple
                    tab-completion for Ex mode. Flipped J/K and gT/gt. Other
                    bug fixes and improvements.
* version 0.7:      added support for user-defined key mappings (`:nmap {lhs}
                    {rhs}`/`:nunmap {lhs}`), undo history, optional vim-like
                    search, command-line mode history, and various
                    customization options (mode indicator colors and
                    prefix/suffix; line numbers prefix/suffix).
                    Removed the separate command-line bar (the input bar is now
                    used instead).
                    Other bug fixes and improvements.
