# Description:
Add vi/vim-like modes and keybindings to WeeChat.


# Download:
weechat-vimode is available in the WeeChat scripts repo. You can install it by
running the following command:

    /script install vimode.py

The version on GitHub may be more recent. You can install it from the shell as
follows:

    cd ~/.weechat/python/
    wget 'https://github.com/GermainZ/weechat-vimode/raw/master/vimode.py'
    cd autoload/
    ln -s ../vimode.py .

If you prefer to clone the git repo (allowing you to easily update it), you can
do the following instead:

    git clone 'https://github.com/GermainZ/weechat-vimode.git'
    ln -s /path/to/git/repo/vimode.py ~/.weechat/python/autoload/vimode.py

# Usage:
To switch to Normal mode, press `Esc` or `Ctrl+Space`.

Two bar items are provided:

* **mode_indicator**: shows the currently active mode (e.g. `NORMAL`).
* **vi_buffer**: shows partial commands (e.g. `df`).

You can add them to your input bar. For example, using `iset.pl`:

* `/iset weechat.bar.input.items`
* `<Alt+Enter>`
* Add `[mode_indicator]+` at the start, and `,[vi_buffer]` at the end.
* Final result example:
    `"[mode_indicator]+[input_prompt]+(away),[input_search],
    [input_paste],input_text,[vi_buffer]"`

To switch back to Insert mode, you can use `i`, `a`, `A`, etc.

To execute an Ex command, simply precede it with a ':' while in Normal mode,
for example: ":h" or ":s/foo/bar".


# Showing line numbers:
The `vi_line_numbers` bar (comes with a bar item) is provided but hidden by
default, and can be shown to display line numbers next to the chat window
(similar to vi's `:set number`). You can show it by using the command:
`/set weechat.bar.vi_line_numbers.hidden on`.

(Depending on your configuration, you may need to adjust some of its settings
for it to be displayed correctly, but the defaults should suit most users.)

It is useful for `:<num>` commands, which will start WeeChat's cursor mode and
take you to the appropriate line. You can then use the default key bindings to
quote the message (`Q`, `m` and `q`).

# History:
* version 0.1:      initial release
* version 0.2:      added esc to switch to Normal mode, various key bindings
                    and commands.
* version 0.2.1:    fixes/refactoring
* version 0.3:      separate operators from motions and better handling. Added
                    yank operator, I/p. Other fixes and improvements. The
                    Escape key should work flawlessly on WeeChat ≥ 0.4.4.
* version 0.4:      added: f, F, t, T, r, R, W, E, B, gt, gT, J, K, ge, gE, X,
                    ~, ,, ;, ^^, ^Wh, ^Wj, ^Wk, ^Wl, ^W=, ^Wx, ^Ws, ^Wv, ^Wq,
                    :!cmd, :sp, :vsp.
                    Improved substitutions (:s/foo/bar). Rewrote key handling
                    logic to take advantage of WeeChat API additions.
                    Many fixes and improvements. WeeChat ≥ 1.0.0 required.
* version 0.5:      added: line numbers bar (disabled by default), :<num>
                    commands, C, D. Many fixes and improvements.
